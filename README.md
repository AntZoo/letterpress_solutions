# Letterpress Solutions Generator

I was a bit bored and wrote this little app that generates valid English words from a given string of characters. It was designed as a way to cheat at Letterpress games; after accomplishing the task I got bored of playing Letterpress and deleted it from my iPhone. :P

PS. The file with words comes from MIT, so I guess I should say thanks to them for it.
